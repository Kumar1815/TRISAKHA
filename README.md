# TRISAKHA
Trisakha is name after the Bilva Patra Tree which is a sacred tree in Hindhuism and is used for worshipping Lord Shiva.The word Trisakha means “3 branches with each branch representing “Icha Shakti” meaning the energy of will power, the second branch representing “Jnana Shakti” meaning the energy of Knowledge and the last branch representing “Kriya Shakti” meaning energy of hard work.  Trisakha Foundation is a Trust dedicated to conserve our natural habitats and the communities dependent on them. We believe that the health and well-being of our planet is vital not only for the environment, but also for the people and animals that reside along with the environment so its meaningless to look at environmental preservation without looking at the human aspect to it. Founded by a group of passionate and dedicated individuals, we have been working tirelessly to raise awareness about environmental issues and to advocate for sustainable practices. Our team is made up of experts in a variety of fields, including biology, ecology, and policy, who work together to find solutions to the complex and pressing challenges facing our planet.  We are committed to making a positive impact on the environment through a variety of means, including education and outreach, research and monitoring, and direct action. Whether it's through our educational programs for schoolchildren or our advocacy efforts at the policy level, we strive to create meaningful change for the betterment of the environment. We believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting and preserving the natural world, and we are grateful for the support of our donors, volunteers, and partners in this important work. Together, we can create a healthier, more sustainable future for all.
